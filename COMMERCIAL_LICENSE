# COMMERCIAL LICENSE

**guardian-USB - Commercial Licensing & Enterprise Edition**
*(c) 2025 MK2112 [mk2112@protonmail.com](mailto:mk2112@protonmail.com)*

GuardianUSB is distributed in two editions:
* **Community Edition** - Open-source, licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0). This edition includes the guardianusb-daemon, CLI tools, a tray app and additional features as published on the public repository.
* **Enterprise Edition** - Commercially licensed version of guardian-USB with additional functionality and support.

## Enterprise Edition

The **Enterprise Edition** is available under a separate commercial license agreement. This license is intended for organizations:
* Requiring functionality beyond the Community Edition (e.g., centralized policy management, multi-device deployments, reporting dashboards, or remote administration).
* Wishing to integrate GuardianUSB into proprietary systems or products without the obligations of the AGPL.

## Licensing Options

1. **Community Edition (AGPLv3)**
   * Free
   * Obligations: Any modifications and derivative works must also be released under AGPLv3 if distributed or made available to others.

2. **Enterprise Edition (Commercial License)**
   * Paid license, terms negotiated per organization.
   * Grants rights to:
     * Use guardian-USB internally without AGPLv3 obligations
     * Integrate into proprietary or closed-source products
     * Deploy enterprise features not present in the Community Edition

## Getting a Commercial License

To obtain a commercial license or Enterprise Edition subscription, please contact:
**[mk2112@protonmail.com](mailto:mk2112@protonmail.com)**

Please include in your inquiry:
* Your organization name
* Intended use case (e.g., enterprise deployment, integration, resale)
* Scale of deployment (number of endpoints / devices)

## Important Notes

* The **Community Edition remains AGPLv3**. Nothing in this notice alters or restricts your rights for that edition under that license.
* The **Enterprise Edition** features are not part of the **Community Edition** and are therefore not available under AGPL. Instead, the **Enterprise Edition** may include access to source code under negotiated commercial license terms.
* Pricing and terms are tailored to organizational requirements and scale.
